easily generate lookalike usernames with a simple click (not counting using the keyboard to type out the command to execute this and the account name)

made this so my life is easier while making accounts like @wiivd1zks (actual username this can generate) so people like eggnoggles have a harder time finding usernames that look similar (see https://twitter.com/roobl64 and https://roobi.straw.page for context)

please only use this for good things like i do
